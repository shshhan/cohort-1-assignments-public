# Task Completion Checklist

## After Making Changes
1. **Docker Services**: Restart affected containers
   ```bash
   docker compose restart [service-name]
   # or for Blockscout services:
   docker compose -f docker-compose.blockscout.yml restart [service-name]
   ```

2. **Test Endpoints**: Verify all routes work
   - http://localhost:8080/explorer/ (Blockscout via Caddy)
   - http://localhost:8080/rpc (Geth RPC via Caddy)
   - http://localhost:4000 (Direct Blockscout)

3. **Check Logs**: Monitor for errors
   ```bash
   docker compose logs
   docker compose -f docker-compose.blockscout.yml logs
   ```

4. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure services can communicate
   - Check Docker network: `docker network ls`
   - Inspect network: `docker network inspect 1b_geth-network`

## No Specific Testing Framework
This project doesn't use conventional testing frameworks. Testing is done by:
- Verifying HTTP endpoints return expected responses
- Checking Docker container health status  
- Manual verification of blockchain explorer functionality

## Git Workflow
- Commit changes only when explicitly requested
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Current branch: assignment-1b
